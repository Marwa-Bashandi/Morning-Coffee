# Morning-Coffee

A promotional ad for a fictional coffee machine brand called "Beany Beans" 
Ad Concept: Imagine an animated-style ad featuring a tiny worker named "Joe" inside the coffee machine. Joe moves enthusiastically between buttons and levers, meticulously taking care of every detail in preparing the coffee. Through Joe's character, we convey the message that every cup of coffee is crafted with precision and care as if a real expert is working inside the machine to deliver the perfect coffee experience!
